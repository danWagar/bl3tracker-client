## Summary

Borderlands 3 is a game where 'loot', or in game items, are a large driver of the primary gameplay loop.
Unfortunately when a player is in the main gameplay loop the game lacks features which allow the player
to examine their inventory in the 'Bank', which is the shared inventory space between players, or inventory
that is held by a character that is not currently being played.

Because loot is such an important factor in the game, and because storage space is limited, a player must
be discerning about which items he or she chooses to pick up and which items are discarded from a full
inventory. This process is made much more difficult by the lack of in-game features to examine a players
inventory. The BL3 Gear Tracker app rectifies this issue by allowing the player to add their in-game inventory
to an online app which can be viewed while playing the game. The app organizes the items in an intuitive way,
making it easy to find items the player is looking for.
